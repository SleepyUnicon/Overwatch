# of truth), so every image ever released before 2026-07-26 carried 0.0.0.

# It changes nothing today: swap-using-move is told which image to boot by the

# therefore no flag, and picks a slot by COMPARING these versions -- with both
# slots claiming 0.0.0 the tie-break is arbitrary and an update can silently
