# Flash a Blink CYD **whose flash-encryption eFuses are burned** (the original
# unit, fused 2026-07-17). Such a chip boots only images encrypted with its
# device key: a plain `west flash` writes plaintext the ROM cannot read and the
# board sits dead until re-flashed with THIS script. (The board still works;
# only the flashing path changed.)
#
# NOT every CYD is fused. Pointed at a plaintext board this script writes
# ciphertext the ROM reads as garbage -- "invalid header" and a boot loop until
# it is re-flashed in plaintext (2026-08-10, board a4f00f5e7b14). Nothing is
# bricked and no eFuse is burned by the mistake, but a flashing cycle is lost,
# so the script now reads FLASH_CRYPT_CNT and refuses a chip that is not fused.
#
# Key: ~/.blink/flash_key.bin (override with BLINK_FLASH_KEY). The eFuse
# copy is sealed inside the chip and unreadable -- the file is the only usable
# copy in the world. KEEP A BACKUP OFF THIS DISK. No key file = no future
# updates, ever.
#
# Build first (sysbuild + MCUboot, also mandatory since the same date):
#   west build --sysbuild -d build-sb -b esp32_devkitc/esp32/procpu . \
#     -- -DSB_CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y -DUSE_CCACHE=0
#
# Usage: tools/flash_encrypted.sh [--logo FILE.bin | --keep-logo] [port]
#   (port defaults to the first /dev/cu.usbserial*; opening it resets the
#   board -- stop any logger first)
#
# The company logo partition (firmware/src/logo_parse.h): --logo writes a
# .bin built by tools/encode_logo.py, encrypted like the other two images;
# with neither flag the partition is ERASED so the unit is an individual one,
# same as tools/burn.sh. --keep-logo leaves it alone -- for a dev board that
# is re-flashed many times a day and should keep the logo it has.
