# Shared flash-encryption detection, sourced by the scripts that write flash.
#
# Both directions destroy a working boot: encrypted images on an unfused chip,
# or plaintext on a fused one. Either leaves the board looping on "invalid
# header" until it is re-flashed the other way (nothing is bricked -- flashing
# burns no eFuses). So whatever opens the serial port asks the chip first.
#
#   efuse_probe <port> [etools_dir]
#     always returns 0; sets EFUSE_STATE to encrypted|plaintext|unknown,
#     plus EFUSE_BITS, EFUSE_MAC and (when unknown) EFUSE_REASON. Reboots the
#     chip back into its application before returning -- see efuse_release.
#
# Written defensively for `set -euo pipefail` callers: a grep that matches
# nothing must not abort the script before it can explain itself.

# BLINK_ETOOLS overrides the directory; tests/ci/check_factory.sh points it at
# stubs so the scripts that source this can run against no chip at all.

# espefuse leaves the chip sitting in the ROM download bootloader: it has
# --before but no --after (checked against 5.1.0), and its teardown is a bare
# port close. A probe that is not immediately followed by a flash would then
# leave the board dark with no firmware running -- dev.sh builds for minutes
# after probing, and aborts entirely if the build fails. esptool boots what is
# already in flash; a caller that does go on to flash re-enters download mode
# by itself, so this costs a couple of seconds and nothing else.
