# Compiles firmware/src/usage_view.c UNCHANGED against real LVGL and drives the
# same public functions proto.c calls. Only two things are replaced: the panel
# (the flush callback writes a plain framebuffer instead of an ILI9341) and the
# handful of Zephyr macros usage_view.c reaches for.
#
# Why this exists: tests/usage_layout/host_test.c proves the boxes do not
# overlap, and that is not the same as the screen reading well. The first run
# of this found the context bar butting flush against its own "100%" readout --
# legal by the overlap test, because touching is not overlapping, and visible
# only at 100%, which is exactly when someone is staring at that meter.
#
# Needs the Zephyr LVGL checkout. Set LVGL_DIR to override.

# Derive lv_conf.h from whatever LVGL is checked out, rather than vendoring a

# three Montserrat sizes, arc, bar, label -- so the only edit needed is to turn
# the file on: it guards its entire body behind `#if 0` so an unconfigured
# project fails loudly instead of silently building with defaults.

# out of step with the LVGL the firmware actually builds against, which is the
