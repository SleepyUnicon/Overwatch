# Build the `blink` program for THIS platform, as a directory: dist/blink/blink
# (blink.exe on Windows) plus dist/blink/_internal/.
#
# One directory, not one file. A one-file build unpacks 50 MB into a temp
# directory on every run, and macOS scans every file it writes: 5 to 11 s
# before the first line of Python, on `blink status` and everything else
# (2026-08-29). tools/package_binary.py turns the directory into the archive
# the feed serves.
#
#   tools/build_binary.sh [outdir]
#
# PyInstaller cannot cross-compile, so each platform's binary is built on that
# platform -- see .github/workflows/release-binaries.yml, which does exactly
# this on a macOS and a Linux runner and attaches the results to the release.
#
# The customer needs none of this. It exists so they need none of it: no
# Python, no virtualenv, no pip, no PyPI at install time.

# Packaging and test machinery that PyInstaller collects on its own and this
# program never imports. It only ever showed up on Linux -- 323 modules the
# macOS build did not have, led by setuptools at 1.1 MB -- which is why the
# Linux download was twice the size of the others for the same program.
#
# esptool imports bitstring, which picks its backend by importlib at runtime
# -- invisible to PyInstaller's analysis, so bitstring and bitarray are
# collected whole. Its other backend, tibs, is only chosen behind an
# environment variable nobody sets, so it stays out (0.9 MB).
#
# espefuse and espsecure ship in the same wheel and are deliberately NOT
# here. The daemon used espefuse to read one eFuse bit before a flash, and
# espefuse imports espsecure, which imports `cryptography`: 12 MB of native
# code, a third of the whole download, for that one bit (2026-08-30).
# pc/efuse_probe.py reads it through esptool's own chip class instead.
# Excluded by name so a future esptool that happens to import one of them
# fails here, at build time, not by quietly doubling the download.
#
# Nothing under pc/ imports any of these, and neither does esptool, pyserial
# or ecdsa (checked against the pinned versions). asyncio and multiprocessing
# are also collected and also unused, but they are left in: together they are
# 0.4 MB, and unlike the list below they are plausible lazy imports for some
# future dependency, where a wrong exclusion surfaces as a crash on a
# customer's machine rather than at build time.
