"""Release fetch and serial push, for OTA while the board is tethered.

USB-bridge mode has no network on the board -- run_usb() never starts
net_worker, so the firmware's own HTTPS updater is unreachable and the update
row did nothing there. We have both an internet connection and the board's
serial link, so the split is: we fetch from the same GitHub release feed the
WiFi path uses, and push the image down; the board writes and verifies it with
exactly the same code either way.

Nothing here trusts the transport, but note WHERE that check now lives. Over
WiFi the board hashed what it received. Over USB the board is not part of the
transfer at all -- esptool writes slot0 directly -- so it has no bytes to hash,
and the verification happens on this side instead: pc/bridge.py checks the
download against the manifest's sha256 before calling flash(), and esptool's
own write_flash reads the written region's MD5 back off the chip before it
returns. Both matter more here than they would over HTTPS, because slot0 is
written in place: there is no test boot and no automatic revert to catch a bad
image.
