"""The daemon updating itself.

The board could always update itself; this half never could. A customer's
binary stayed at whatever they downloaded, forever, while the firmware feed it
drives moved on -- and since the daemon is what decides and performs firmware
updates, the stale half was the one in charge.

Three things guard this path, because it is the highest-privilege operation in
the product: a login agent on someone's machine, replacing its own executable
with bytes from the internet.

  1. The manifest is SIGNED, and this refuses to read the daemon block out of
     one that does not verify. The firmware has had this all along -- MCUboot
     will not boot an image signed by anything but the release key -- so a
     compromised release feed could never push firmware. It could have pushed
     a daemon. The key here is deliberately NOT MCUboot's: one key, one job.
  2. The download is checked against the size and sha256 the manifest names.
  3. The replacement is SELF-TESTED before it becomes the service's target --
     the new binary has to run and report the version it claims. A corrupt
     binary that reaches the login service is a device that never comes back
     and a customer who has to start over; 200 ms of proof is cheap next to
     that.

And one brake that is not technical: `daemon.auto` in the manifest. Ship with
it false, turn it on when the path has earned it, turn it off within minutes if
a release goes wrong. Auto-update without a remote off switch is a mechanism
with no brakes.
