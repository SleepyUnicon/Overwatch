"""Execution state: what every live Claude Code session is doing, and its agents.

The handoff document specifies this state machine in terms of things a daemon
cannot see from outside -- "CLI process waiting on stdin", "tool execution with
0% CPU". Both mean finding the right process among several, sampling it, and
inferring intent from a number that is legitimately zero whenever a tool waits
on the network. That is a guess dressed as a measurement.

Claude Code announces every one of these transitions through its hook
interface, so this reads the announcements instead:

    UserPromptSubmit  -> a turn started              -> running
    PreToolUse        -> a tool started              -> running
    PostToolUse       -> a tool finished             -> running
    Notification      -> Claude Code wants the user  -> waiting
    Stop              -> the turn completed          -> idle (your turn)
    StopFailure       -> the turn died on an API error -> failed
    SessionStart/End  -> the session's lifetime      -> no claim
    SubagentStart/Stop-> one agent's lifetime

`idle` means "finished, and waiting on you" -- it is a claim on the person's
attention, and on the panel it is amber, not green. That is why a session
that merely OPENED is not idle: a terminal somebody opened and has not typed
into yet needs nothing from anybody, and a session that ENDED needs nothing
ever again. Both say nothing rather than call for attention.

`waiting` is authoritative rather than inferred: Notification is the event
Claude Code fires when it needs a human, which is what "is the process blocked
on stdin" was trying to establish indirectly. `failed` earns its own state
because on a usage gauge it is the headline -- StopFailure carries
`error: "rate_limit"` among its causes, and being rate limited is the single
thing this product exists to warn about.

`stuck` is a state the protocol still names and no provider produces any
more. It was inferred from silence -- a turn announced and then nothing for
N seconds -- and every N cried wolf on the desk: 60 s on a test suite, 180 s
on a nine-minute polling loop, 600 s on a seventeen-minute think with the
API connection open the whole time (all 2026-08-29). The hooks cannot tell
a long turn from a wedged one, so the daemon no longer guesses. A turn is
`running` for as long as it takes; a session that ends without saying so
drops out after ABANDONED_AFTER_S. Red is reserved for `failed`, which is
an event, not an inference.

What silence cannot say, a pid can. A session whose terminal was closed, or
that was killed, fires no SessionEnd and its slot simply stops changing --
indistinguishable from a seventeen-minute think, which is why the hour-long
ABANDONED_AFTER_S was the only thing that ever collected it. The hook now
records the process it ran from, so the daemon can ask the kernel a question
with a true answer instead of inferring one from a clock: a process that no
longer exists is not thinking. See LIVENESS below, and the latch that guards
it, because what $PPID means in Claude Code's hook runner has not been
measured yet.

ON DISK
-------
    ~/.blink/state/<session_id>.state   one JSON slot, newest event wins
    ~/.blink/state/<session_id>.waiting  present while a human is being asked
    ~/.blink/state/<session_id>/<agent_id>   one empty file per live agent

One file per session because a single global slot silently misreports the
moment a second terminal exists. One file per AGENT because that makes the
count exact without a lock: two agents starting at once cannot race on a
shared counter, and a stop removes precisely the agent that stopped rather
than decrementing and hoping.

And a separate file for WAITING, for the same reason one step further in.
"Newest event wins" is only true if the newest event is the last one WRITTEN,
and on Codex it is not: the first interactive session anyone captured fired
PreToolUse and PermissionRequest in the same second, twice
(docs/research/codex-hook-contract.md). Those are two shim processes racing
for one slot, and the shim ends with mv -f, so whichever finishes second wins
regardless of which event happened first. Lose that race and the slot says
`running` over a session that is blocked on a person -- for exactly as long as
the person takes to answer, which is the whole interval this feature exists to
show. The next event does correct it, but the next event IS the answer, so the
correction lands the moment it stops mattering.

A marker cannot lose that race because it does not share a file with anything:
PermissionRequest creates it, the events that mean the person answered
(PostToolUse, Interrupt, Stop, UserPromptSubmit) remove it, and create and
unlink are each atomic on their own path. PreToolUse deliberately does NOT
remove it -- that is the one event known to arrive in the same second, so
letting it clear the marker would reintroduce the race it exists to escape.

# LIVENESS
# --------
# The hook writes the pid of the process it ran from. A slot whose pid names
# no living process belongs to a session that is over, whatever its clock
# says, and it is dropped at once rather than held for ABANDONED_AFTER_S.
#
# A pid only means something in the namespace that issued it, and the hook
# writes into the same ~/.blink/state the daemon reads. That was read as "both
# under one HOME on one host, so there is no remote case to defend against",
# and one shared HOME is not one pid namespace: Claude Code running in a
# devcontainer with ~/.blink bind-mounted writes a CONTAINER pid, which the
# daemon on the host resolves against the host's table. Nothing was copied
# between machines -- the file never moved -- and the number in it still does
# not name the process that wrote it.
#
# That is the one direction this check is not allowed to fail in: an absent
# host pid reads as ProcessLookupError, so a session that is alive and working
# is dropped from the panel at once. Every other way of being wrong keeps a
# session too long.
#
# It is the suspension below that defends against it, and it is why the
# suspension is deliberately eager and no longer permanent: the first slot the
# daemon sees written seconds ago by a pid the host does not have suspends the
# feature for as long as no pid proves otherwise, which on a container desk is
# forever. What that leaves open is a MIXED desk -- host sessions and
# container sessions at once -- where a live host pid keeps re-arming the check
# that the container sessions then fail. Closing that needs a marker in the
# slot itself (the hook writing a boot id or nodename, and the daemon ignoring
# a pid from another one), which is a change to tools/blink-hook.sh and to
# every shim already installed; noted, not done.
#
# PID REUSE is the one wrong answer available: the kernel eventually hands a
# dead session's number to some unrelated new process, and the slot then looks
# alive. That is a miss, not a false alarm -- the session simply keeps being
# reported until ABANDONED_AFTER_S collects it, which is exactly today's
# behaviour and the reason no process start time is recorded alongside. Every
# way this check can be wrong has to point in that direction; a false DEATH
# would blank a working session off the panel, which is worse than the bug
# being fixed here.
_PID_MAX = 2 ** 31 - 1

# POSIX ONLY, and this is not a portability nicety. On POSIX, os.kill(pid, 0)
# asks a question. On Windows, CPython implements os.kill as
# TerminateProcess(handle, sig) for every signal but the two console events --
# so "is Claude Code still alive?" would KILL Claude Code, with exit code 0.
# There is a right answer on Windows (OpenProcess + GetExitCodeProcess through
# ctypes) and it is not written yet, so Windows keeps today's rules: the pid is
# read, bounds-checked and ignored. A missing feature there beats a daemon that
# shoots the sessions it is reporting on.

FRESH_SLOT_S = 10.0

# THE SUSPENSION, and why it is not optional -- and why it is no longer a
# one-way latch.
#
# Nobody has measured whether $PPID in the hook is Claude Code's own process
# or a short-lived shell Claude Code spawned to run the hook. If it is the
# latter, the pid is dead within milliseconds of being written and the naive
# reading of this feature would drop EVERY live session -- a blank panel, far
# worse than an hour-stale one. A bind-mounted ~/.blink (see LIVENESS above)
# produces the same symptom for a different reason and needs the same answer.
#
# So the feature tests its own premise on real data, in both directions:
#
#   - A slot written seconds ago whose pid is already gone cannot have been
#     written by that pid's process. Stop believing pids, fall back to
#     ABANDONED_AFTER_S exactly as before, and say so once on stderr.
#   - A slot whose pid DOES name a living process is the same kind of
#     evidence pointing the other way, and it is the stronger of the two:
#     it is a pid out of this very directory resolving in this very process
#     table. It restores belief.
#
# It used to latch off permanently, and that was wrong on an ordinary event.
# A terminal closed within FRESH_SLOT_S of its last hook event fires no
# SessionEnd (SIGHUP does not), leaving a fresh slot with a dead pid -- which
# is indistinguishable from the wrapper case at the instant it is seen. On a
# launchd daemon that runs for weeks, one closed terminal disabled the feature
# until the next reboot, and printed a diagnosis that has since been MEASURED
# FALSE on this machine ($PPID is `claude` on every live slot, checked with
# ps -o comm= on three of them, 2026-09-02). Making it recoverable is what
# makes the eagerness affordable: the check may now suspend itself on weak
# evidence, because the next living pid takes it back.
#
# What does not change: the fail-safe direction. Suspended means "behave
# exactly as the daemon did before this feature existed", never "guess".
#
# Process-wide rather than per-provider because what a slot's pid means is a
# fact about this machine, not about a directory: `blink status` builds its
# own short-lived provider and should inherit the conclusion rather than
# re-derive it. The message is printed at most once per process for the same
# reason it always was -- a two-second poll would otherwise turn a real
# warning into 43,200 log lines a day.
#
# TO RETIRE THIS: measure it on Linux and Windows too. Run a real session,
# read a fresh slot's pid, and check it against the `claude` process
# (ps -p <pid> -o comm=). macOS is done. If the pid is the CLI itself

        marker whose removal never ran (a crash between the two, a directory
        that turned unwritable) would otherwise pin a session on "Waiting for
        you" for as long as the session lasts. Bounding it by the same hour
        that bounds every other file here means the marker can never outlive
        the census entry it modifies.
