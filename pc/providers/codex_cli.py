"""Codex CLI's rollout log, as a second provider on the ingestion bus.

Same shape as every other source here: read a figure another program has
already worked out, from a file it writes for its own reasons. Nothing in
this module authenticates to anyone, and it never reads a prompt, a reply or
a tool call -- only the `rate_limits` object Codex records alongside its
token counts.

Where the numbers are
---------------------
Codex appends one JSON object per line to

    ~/.codex/sessions/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/rollout-<stamp>-<uuid>.jsonl

and after a turn completes it writes an `event_msg` whose payload type is
`token_count`. That payload carries `rate_limits`:

    "rate_limits": {
      "primary":   {"used_percent": 0.0, "window_minutes": 300,   "resets_at": ...},
      "secondary": {"used_percent": 0.0, "window_minutes": 10080, "resets_at": ...}
    }

300 minutes is the five-hour window and 10080 is the seven-day one, which is
exactly the pair the panel draws.

Three things about that file are worth stating here, because each is a way to
be confidently wrong rather than to fail:

  - `primary` and `secondary` are POSITIONS, not windows. This matches them by
    `window_minutes` and only falls back to the position when the field is
    missing, for the same reason claude_desktop range-checks its percentages:
    a rename upstream should cost us the source, not swap the two dials.

  - `resets_at` is an absolute epoch in SECONDS, unlike Claude Desktop's
    sample timestamps, which are milliseconds. Verified against a real file,
    2026-08-27; the sanity bound below is what would catch it changing.

  - Codex compresses a rollout to `.jsonl.zst` once it is a week old
    (codex-rs/rollout/src/compression.rs, MIN_ROLLOUT_AGE). The glob below
    sees only plain `.jsonl`, which is right for as long as that floor is
    days: the freshest reading is always in a live, plain file, and a file
    old enough to be compressed is a week past being stale anyway.
    tests/ci/check_codex_contract.sh fails the day the floor drops.

  - The newest file is not always the newest reading. A terminal left open
    with no turn in it produces a rollout file with no `token_count` at all,
    and its mtime still moves. So this reads the few most recently touched
    files and takes the freshest event out of all of them, rather than
    trusting the first one it finds.

def _project_name(cwd) -> str:
    """The project name a Codex `cwd` implies, or "".

    The last path component, with three refusals. The first two are the ones
    the Claude hook shim already applies to its own cwd: `.` and `..` are
    directory entries rather than names, and control characters are stripped
    because this string is JSON-encoded into a line the firmware scans for
    quotes.

    The double quote goes with them, on that same sentence's reason rather
    than a new one, and it was the half the sentence promised and did not
    do. firmware/src/msg_parse.c reads a string value by copying the bytes
    between the first `"` after the key's colon and the NEXT `"`, and
    unescapes nothing. So a project called mid\"way -- json.dumps writes it
    onto the wire correctly, as a backslash and a quote -- arrives at the
    panel as `mid` and a trailing backslash, because msg_get_str stops at the
    escaped quote and hands back the escape character with it. A double quote
    is a legal character in a directory name on every platform this reads
    rollouts from.

    Stripped, not refused, which is how the control characters beside it are
    handled and for the same reason: mid\"way is still recognisably the
    owner's project as `midway`, while a name that was ONLY quotes falls
    through to the drawable-ASCII rule below and lets the count speak.

    The backslash needs no rule of its own: it is the other path separator,
    so the rsplit above has already thrown away everything up to the last
    one. Quote and backslash are the only two characters json.dumps escapes
    once the control characters are gone, so with those two accounted for
    nothing reaches msg_get_str that it will misread.

    The third is about the panel rather than about safety, and it is the one
    the shim has no need of. firmware/src/fmt.c draws a label through
    fmt_ascii(), which replaces every codepoint it has no ASCII spelling for
    with "?" -- tests/fmt/host_test.c pins the UTF-8 bytes of an e-acute
    (\\xc3\\xa9) arriving as "?".
    A wholly non-Latin name therefore reaches the desk as a row of question
    marks, which says less than the count the panel falls back to when there
    is no name at all. So a name has to carry at least one ASCII letter or
    digit to be worth sending: a name with a Latin stem keeps it and loses
    the rest, and one with no Latin at all is refused so the count speaks
    instead.

    Not capped here, and the quote rule above is the same division read from
    the other side. protocol.session owns the WIRE: the byte bound, and the
    truncation on a UTF-8 boundary that the bound needs. This function owns
    what may be a NAME, which is what a character class is -- and putting the
    quote rule in protocol.session would apply one provider's bug to every
    provider's label, while a second byte cap here would be a second thing to
    keep in step with the firmware.

# The two errors upstream itself says do not fail a turn

        An answer is cached once the first line has been READ, and only then.
        That is the whole of the rule, and the distinction it turns on is the
        one `session_meta_cwd` was written to hand back: a head this could
        not read at all, and a head it read and then found nothing usable in.

        The second is permanent and is cached, empty answer included. A
        rollout is append-only and its line 1 never changes, so a first line
        that is complete and carries no `cwd` -- or a `cwd` `_project_name`
        refuses -- will still carry none on the ten thousandth poll, and
        re-deriving that from 19 KB of embedded system prompt every two
        seconds is waste that grows with whatever upstream puts in that
        record next.

        The first is not permanent, and caching it was a bug. Codex creates a
        rollout and then writes its ~19 KB `session_meta` into it, and this
        daemon now looks every two seconds on the fast poll -- not the
        minute this cache was written under -- so globbing that file between
        the two is ordinary rather than rare. `_head_line` correctly refuses
        the unterminated line, "" came back, and "" was then remembered
        FOREVER: `_prune_names` only forgets paths that have left the recent
        set, and the session being written to is the one that stays in it for
        hours. The panel then said "A session is waiting for you" with no
        subject, permanently, for the session the owner is most likely
        looking at. So an unread head is left uncached and simply asked again
        next poll, which is a 128 KB read of a file that was written
        milliseconds ago and is still in the page cache.

        A first line longer than HEAD_BYTES is the one case that pays that
        re-read forever rather than for one poll. It is not worth a third
        branch: that session has already lost its name on every poll anyway,
        which is the failure HEAD_BYTES is set several times over the

        # is not a disagreement to be settled on recency -- it is the older
        # and blinder of two answers, and the newer one simply replaces it.
        # That is the whole reason this is a dict update in one direction
        # rather than a merge that compares timestamps.
        #
        # Unioned rather than substituted, though: a Codex session that was
        # already open when the hooks were installed has no slot and never
        # will get one, because the hooks only fire from the next turn on.
        # Dropping it would make a running terminal vanish from the panel,
