"""One binary: the setup, the status check, and the bridge itself.

A customer downloads a single file and runs it. There is no Python to install,
no virtualenv to build, no repository to clone, and nothing left behind that
they have to keep in place -- `blink install` copies the binary into
~/.blink/bin and points the login service at that copy, so the download is
disposable the moment it finishes.

This replaces install.sh. The shell version needed Python 3.9+ on the machine,
built a virtualenv, and pulled two packages from PyPI at install time -- three
things that could fail on a customer's machine for reasons they could do
nothing about, and one of them (an unpinned PyPI resolve) meant two people
installing a week apart could get different software.

The status line shim stays a shell script on purpose. It runs on EVERY status
line render, many times a minute, and a frozen binary takes 100-400 ms to start
because it unpacks itself first -- that delay would land in the customer's
prompt. A few lines of sh start in single-digit milliseconds.

    simply stops growing. The app is still running and still right, it is
