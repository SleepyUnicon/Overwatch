    The *_resets_in_s fields carry the remaining seconds. The board has no
    wall clock when tethered over USB, so it cannot derive a countdown from
    the absolute resets_at timestamps; it ticks these down locally instead.
    -1 means unknown. The absolute timestamps are kept for readability and
    for any consumer that does know the time.

    Known models are ALSO flattened into sonnet_pct/opus_pct: the board's
    JSON scanner reads scalar keys only, and its per-model peek needs these
    without growing a full array parser.

    `stale` describes the FIRST provider only, and `p2_stale` the second.
    Freshness belongs to a reading, not to the panel: the two providers are
    read from different places at different times, and the board shows one
    page at a time, so a single flag for both meant a live page could be
    labelled old because the page you were not looking at had gone quiet.

    `stale` is a declared field, not an afterthought bolted on by a caller:
    this function is the one place the wire contract is defined.
    pc/statusline_source.py, the only producer of usage messages, sets it
    when the payload it read has outlived its own freshness window.

The firmware reads this field: proto.c's "usage" handler calls
    msg_get_bool(json, "stale", ...) and sets USAGE_STATUS_STALE when it is
    true, after the update and models calls that set OK internally.

    An absent key leaves it false on the board, so a daemon older than that
    firmware reads as OK rather than as a permanent warning. Older firmware
    given this field simply ignores it -- it degrades to a green dot on a
    stale reading, which is the behaviour that existed before either side
    knew about the field.

    `age_s` and `p2_age_s` are how old each READING is -- seconds between the
    moment the source observed it and the moment this message was built --
    and -1 where that is unknown.

    They exist because the board could not work this out for itself, and had
    been getting it wrong in a way that could not show. usage_view.c keeps an
    `age_s` counter, zeroes it on every arriving usage message and ticks it
    once a second, and render_age() prints the caption only once it reaches
    120. But the daemon pushes every POLL_INTERVAL_S = 60 s whether or not
    the reading changed, so that counter was reset twice as often as the
    caption needed to appear: it measured the age of the MESSAGE, never of
    the figure, and 120 was unreachable. The label, its formatter and its
    place on the panel were all built and none of them had ever appeared.

    The distinction is the whole point on a source that goes quiet. Claude
    Desktop only refreshes its cache while somebody is at the machine, so a
    four-hour-old percentage was being re-sent every minute and drawn with
    the same confidence as a live one -- observed on a real desk, 2026-08-30,
    and reported as the panel being "stuck".

    Per provider, for the same reason `stale` is: the board shows one page at
    a time and the two readings are taken from different files at different
    times.

    -1 means the daemon did not say. Firmware that understands these falls
    back to counting from the message in that case, which is exactly the old
    behaviour, so an older daemon loses nothing it used to have. Older
    firmware ignores both keys.

    `active_age_s` is the other freshness question, and it is one field for
    the whole desk rather than one per provider: how long since ANY tool on
    this machine last wrote anything at all, whether or not what it wrote
    carried a percentage. The board dozes on this one and captions on
    `age_s`, which is the same split it already makes between
    SLEEP_ABSENT_AFTER_S ("is anybody here", four hours) and
    SLEEP_READING_STALE_AFTER_S ("is this number old", half an hour) --
    two questions, two numbers, and answering one with the other is the
    whole class of bug this exists to close.

    They diverge for exactly one reason. pc/providers/claude_cli remembers
    the last payload that had a five-hour window and re-offers it carrying
    its ORIGINAL mtime, because the rewrite that drops an expired window
    does not make the last real reading untrue. When that remembered
    reading wins the session dial it also becomes the frame whose age is
    reported -- so a status line written five seconds ago can arrive here
    stamped twelve hours old, and a board that dozes at four hours closes
    its eyes on somebody who is sitting in front of it (measured, field
    review 2026-09-02).

    Per-desk and not per-provider because dozing is a whole-board decision:
    the panel does not sleep one page at a time, and there is no version of
    "Claude is quiet but Codex is not" in which the screen should go dark.
    It is the age of the freshest reading on the bus, across both providers.

    -1 when unknown, like `age_s`. An absent key sends the firmware back to
    `age_s`, and that fallback is EXACT rather than approximate: the two
    numbers can only differ because of the memory described above, and a
    daemon old enough not to send this field has no such memory, so its
    freshest source IS the dial's source. Older firmware ignores the key.

# --------------------------------------------------------------- overage cap

# The first firmware that will accept a percentage above 100.
#
# Every earlier build parses the usage percentages with
# num(json, "weekly_pct", &wp, -1, 100), and proto.c's num() does not clamp an
# out-of-range value -- it returns without writing, leaving the caller's own
# `double sp = 0, wp = 0` initialiser in place. So a reading of 102 does not
# arrive as 100, it arrives as ZERO: at the exact moment somebody crosses their
# weekly limit into extra usage, the panel drops from full to empty.
#
# Observed on a customer's board 2026-08-31. He was running two sources, and
# they disagreed in a way that made it unmistakable: Claude Desktop's cache
# caps its own figure at 100 and drew a full ring, Claude Code reported the
# true 102 and drew nothing. The normalizer merges field-by-field by recency,
# so the two took turns being newest and the ring flipped 100 -> 0 -> 100 -> 0
# every minute.
#
# Holding the number at 100 for those boards is a loss -- "at the limit" and
# "2% past it" become the same picture -- but it is the honest half of the
# truth instead of the opposite of it, and it needs no reflash, which is what
# matters for boards already on desks. Newer firmware is sent the real number
# and draws a full ring under it.
#
# This is 1.2.5 and not 1.2.4 on purpose. The PCT_MAX change and the version
# bump are separate hunks, so a 1.2.4 build without PCT_MAX is constructible --
# one was flashed to a bench board while this was being written. Gating on the
# version that shipped the two together is the only claim the daemon can make
# honestly from a version string alone. The principled fix is for hello to
# advertise the capability rather than have the daemon infer it; that is worth
# doing the next time hello changes for another reason.
