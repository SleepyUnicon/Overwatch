"""The pluggable ingestion bus: every provider, polled and normalized.

This is the seam the daemon holds. claude_usage_bridge asks it for a usage
message and knows nothing about which providers exist, how many sources each
one has, or what any of their files look like -- which is the property that
lets a second provider be added without touching the daemon, the protocol or
the firmware.

A provider that misbehaves is contained here rather than being allowed to
reach the reconnect loop. The daemon's job is to keep a board fed; a parser
for an app we do not control is exactly the kind of code that should never be
able to stop it.
