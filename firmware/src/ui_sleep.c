/*
 * Every reason to stop dozing, asked in one place.
 *
 * wake_when() is the caller's reason -- the app spoke again, or the reading
 * started moving. ui_settings_busy() is this file's own, and it is here
 * because of what dozing takes away rather than because of anything the
 * sleep design says.
 *
 * Settings are asked for by a left swipe on the gauge screen, or by a tap on
 * the right edge zone -- which is the route that still works over the
 * CONNECTING takeover, where the swipe is deliberately refused. Neither
 * gesture opens anything: both raise a flag that ui_settings_service() acts
 * on, and the only call to that lives in the mode loop this function has
 * taken over. So on the shipped build -- USB-only, one loop -- a request made
 * during a peek latched and nothing ever answered it. The panel then opened
 * by itself whenever the board next woke, which is the same bug wearing the
 * other face.
 *
 * That bites hardest in the state that causes it. A board plugged into a
 * computer with no daemon installed, or one that cannot open the port, dozes
 * after 60 s over the CONNECTING screen -- and settings is exactly where the
 * owner goes to fix that. A tap gave them ten seconds of dashboard; it did
 * not give them control.
 *
 * Waking rather than servicing the latch here is deliberate. ui_slide_run()
 * must be driven from a mode loop in thread context, never from under a clip
 * player or an LVGL callback (ui_slide.h), and a peek that opened the panel
 * would then have to decide what to do when its ten seconds ran out with the
 * user halfway through the list. Ending the doze hands the request back to
 * the loop that owns it, and the panel slides in on that loop's first pass.

	 * answered in half an hour, the same 1800 s the daemon uses to set the
	 * `stale` flag it normally tells us. Asking the four-hour question
	 * here left a board waking from an hour's doze green over an hour-old
	 * reading until the next usage message landed, up to a minute later.
	 *
	 * It is also the reading's own AGE, not the desk's. main.c dozes on

	 * five-hour reading. A board woken by a live status line whose dial is
	 * still this morning's SHOULD say the reading is old, because it is.
