"""The setup the customer runs.

This replaces tests/test_install_sh.py. install.sh needed Python on the
customer's machine, built a virtualenv and reached PyPI at install time; the
binary needs none of that, so the shell script and its tests are gone.

Tested against the module rather than the built binary: the logic is the same
either way, and freezing an 11 MB executable per assertion would buy nothing.
The binary itself is exercised end to end by tests/ci/check_install.sh, which
CI runs on a real macOS and Linux runner.
