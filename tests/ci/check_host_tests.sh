# These test the firmware's pure logic on a laptop, with no board and no
# Zephyr -- native_sim is Linux-only, so this is how the C in this project
# gets exercised on a Mac. Eight of them existed and NOTHING ran them
# automatically: each carried a `cc ...` line in a comment that a human was
# expected to copy and paste. A test nobody runs is documentation.
#
# The table below is explicit rather than parsed out of those comments: a
# runner that greps for its own build commands fails open the moment a comment
# is reworded, which is the failure mode of every clever version of this.
