# tools/burn.sh and tools/flash_encrypted.sh are the two programs that decide
# what a unit IS -- its edition, whether it is a company unit, whether it can
# ever take an update -- and until this existed nothing ran them except a
# person with a board on the desk. This runs the real scripts, unmodified,
# with esptool/espefuse/espsecure replaced by stubs that record their calls
# (tests/ci/fakes/bin) and pyserial replaced by a scripted board
# (tests/ci/fakes/pyserial) that replays a boot transcript on every reset and
# answers the edition message. What is asserted is what matters on a
# production line: which images went to which addresses, that the logo
# partition is erased when no logo was asked for, and that every wrong answer
# from the board is a FAILED burn rather than a boxed unit.
