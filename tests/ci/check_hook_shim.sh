# 16. THE TOMBSTONE, and the census it exists to correct.
#
#     Removing the slot is all a slot-counting source ever needed. Codex's
#     rollout reader is not one: a closed session leaves a file that simply
#     stops growing, which is also what a long quiet turn looks like, so it
#     kept counting the session for the full hour the file took to age out --
#     and the union that lets a session with no slot count at all put back
#     every session this branch had just removed. Measured on the owner's
#     desk: one live slot, two Claude sessions, four recent rollouts, and a
#     panel reading six.
#
#     Absence cannot carry the news, because absence is also what a session
#     that never had a hook looks like, and the union exists for that one. So
#     SessionEnd leaves a file that says so.

#      shell, skipping the exit 0 at the bottom of the shim and handing Claude
#      Code a failing hook -- on the event that fires as a person closes their
#      terminal. And 2>/dev/null must come BEFORE the '>' target, because the
#      complaint about a failed redirect is printed by the shell rather than by
#      the command.
