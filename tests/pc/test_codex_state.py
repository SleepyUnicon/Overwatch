waiting marker are claude_state's and are pinned in tests/pc/test_state_machine

adds -- which directory is read, that the caller's arguments are honoured
rather than a default falling back to the real home, that the marker survives
the delegation, and that the (state, name) pairs claude_state returns are
unwrapped to the plain states this module promises.
