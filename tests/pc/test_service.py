"""The login-service backends: what each platform would actually run.

None of this had a test before. The five sys.platform ladders these replaced
were reachable only by installing for real on the platform in question, so
every defect in them -- and there were three on Windows alone -- was found by
a CI runner rather than here. A backend object can be built on any machine and
asked what argv it would hand to launchctl, schtasks or systemctl, which is
most of what there is to get wrong.

This does not replace tests/ci/check_install.sh. That one proves the commands
work; this one proves they are the commands we meant.
